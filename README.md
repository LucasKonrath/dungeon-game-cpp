# Dungeon Game Tests

This repository contains unit tests for the DungeonGame C++ implementation.

The visual callgraph shows the tree structure with:
- üü¢ **Green**: Entry point (`calculateMinimumHP`)
- üü° **Yellow**: Recursive calls exploring valid cells
- üü† **Orange**: Princess room (destination)
- üî¥ **Red**: Out-of-bounds calls (pruned)

## Performance Profiling

Comprehensive profiling tools are available to analyze algorithm performance, memory usage, and optimization opportunities:

### Quick Profiling
```bash
# Run basic performance analysis
make profile

# Run optimized build profiling
make profile-optimized

# Interactive profiling menu
./profile.sh
```

### Advanced Profiling Tools

#### Instruments (macOS)
```bash
# Generate detailed performance trace
make profile-instruments
open instruments_output.trace
```

#### Valgrind (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Call graph analysis
make profile-valgrind
kcachegrind callgrind.out

# Memory leak detection
make profile-memory
```

#### Manual Profiling
```bash
# With gprof
g++ -pg -o profiling_gprof profiling_tests.cpp
./profiling_gprof
gprof profiling_gprof gmon.out > analysis.txt

# With perf (Linux)
perf record ./profiling_optimized
perf report
```

### Profiling Results Analysis

The profiling suite provides insights into:

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Execution Time**: Microsecond-level timing analysis
- üîÑ **Recursive Calls**: Count and patterns of function calls
- üíæ **Memoization Efficiency**: Hit rates and cache effectiveness
- üß† **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption by grid size
- üìä **Scalability**: Performance characteristics as problem size grows

**Sample Output:**
```
=== PROFILING RESULTS ===
Recursive calls: 1799
Memoization hits: 840
Boundary checks: 1797
Total execution time: 4897917 nanoseconds
Average time per call: 2722 ns
Memoization hit rate: 46.69%
```

## Running Tests

### Simple Tests (No external dependencies)

The simple tests use a custom lightweight test framework and don't require any external libraries:

```bash
# Compile and run simple tests
make test
```

Or manually:
```bash
clang++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -g -o simple_tests simple_tests.cpp
./simple_tests
```

### Using CMake
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./simple_tests
```

## Generating Callgraphs

You can generate detailed call traces and visual callgraphs to understand how the algorithm executes:

### Generate Call Trace
```bash
# Generate text trace of function calls
make callgraph
cat callgraph_trace.txt
```

### Generate Visual Callgraph
First install Graphviz (for visualization):
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install graphviz

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

Then generate the visual callgraph:
```bash
# Generate PNG and SVG callgraph images
make callgraph-viz

# Or manually:
dot -Tpng callgraph.dot -o callgraph.png
dot -Tsvg callgraph.dot -o callgraph.svg
```

### Example Callgraph Output

For a 2x2 dungeon:
```
  [-3,  5]
  [ 1, -4]
```

The call trace shows:
1. `calculateMinimumHP` starts the process
2. `recurse(0,0)` explores from top-left
3. Explores both right `(0,1)` and down `(1,0)` paths
4. Eventually reaches princess room `(1,1)` 
5. Uses memoization to avoid recalculation
6. Returns minimum HP needed: **4**

## Test Cases Covered

The tests cover the following scenarios:

1. **Basic functionality** - Standard dungeon traversal
2. **Edge cases** - Single cell dungeons with positive/negative/zero values
3. **Boundary conditions** - Single row/column dungeons
4. **All positive values** - Should return minimum health of 1
5. **All negative values** - Tests worst-case scenario
6. **Mixed values** - Realistic dungeon configurations
7. **Princess room scenarios** - Large positive/negative values in destination
8. **Optimal path planning** - Cases where path choice matters
9. **Performance** - Large grids to verify memoization efficiency
10. **Result validation** - Ensures minimum health is always positive

## Algorithm Description

The DungeonGame class implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum initial health points needed to reach the princess. The algorithm:

1. Uses memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems
2. Works backwards from the destination
3. At each cell, calculates the minimum health needed considering both possible moves (right and down)
4. Ensures the knight never has health ‚â§ 0 during the journey

## Expected Test Results

When all tests pass, you should see output similar to:
```
‚úì PASS: Basic example (expected: 3, got: 3)
‚úì PASS: Single cell negative (expected: 6, got: 6)
‚úì PASS: Single cell positive (expected: 1, got: 1)
...
=== Test Summary ===
Passed: 14
Failed: 0
Total: 14
All tests passed! ‚úì
```
